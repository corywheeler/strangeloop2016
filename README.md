# StrangeLoop 2016
My notes from the StrangeLoop 2016 Conference

## GOVERNMENT HACKING AND HUMAN RIGHTS: THE WHY AND THE HOW... Amie Stepanovich

* FBI hacking
* Early days, not a lot of information
* Finally a judge, Judge Smith, denied an FBI's request to hack a system under the 4th Amendment
* Rule 41
* Tracking Warrents - You don't have to re-issue the warrent
* Judge dind't know if "Premises Unknown" would fall under Rule 41 
* FBI lobied
* ECMA - The wiretap act. Have an increased standard than other types of warrants
* Congress has not put any laws in place for new requirements with todays technological taxonomy
* ECMA is long outdated and is being stretched to allow governmental hacking
* FBI is about to gain the power they want by the mere fact that Congress isn't doing a damn thing.
* James Otis: Against Writs of Assistance
* Australia - has one of the oldest laws on the books for governmental hacking. The also allow "bulk hacking".
* Australian hacking data was handed over to the US and used
* A look around the world shows that really all governments are hacking their citizens, or peoples devices in their country.
* Governments are being provided tools from private organizations
* Operaton Ominous
* Warrior Pride
* UK Investigatory Policy Bill
* We need to be looking at International Law
* Human Rights - Universal Declaration of Human Rights (from the UN)
* Messaging Control
* Causal Damage - External or Internal damage is the result
* Commission of Survailance or Intelligence Gathering
* Human Rights that are violated
  * Due Process
  * Can deprive you of your property rights
  * Privacy - Protected information
  * Freedoms of Expression and Opinion
* There needs to be a presumptive prohibition as it relates to hacking. There needs to be some safeguards in place as it relates to governmental hacking
* Governmental hacking will continue to take place
* What she thinks safeguards look like
  * We need some law that the government needs to abide by
  * Officials need to explain why hacking is the way to get the information
  * Hacking operations must never occur perpetually
  * Applications for hacking should be indepenently reviewed and approved by experts
  * Governments must provide actual notice to the target
  * Officials should publish reports
  * Private entities should never be compelled to engage in activities that impact their own products
  * If scope is exceeded, the operations needs to report back to the judicial authority as such
* None of this is easy
* Human rights should not be sacrificed entirely
